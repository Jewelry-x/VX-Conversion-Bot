# VX Conversion Bot

It is a discord bot that converts `x.com` or `twitter.com` links to `vxtwitter.com` links so the video embed functions.

### Setup instructions

1. Clone the repository to your desired directory.

2. Install the requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

3. Create a `env.py` file that includes `DISCORD_TOKEN`.

4. Run `python bot.py` and that is your bot up and running!

### Usage instructions

As soon as you post a twitter link the bot should post the link including the `vx` fix to it.
